            Inside this repository you will find Nuxt3, Vue3, Vuetify and
            Netlify. I have chosen Nuxt3 for the user and developer experience
            that comes out of the box. As a component framework I chose Vuetify.
            Vuetify makes even it possible for someone like me to create
            something that looks decent :). Netlify was selected because along
            with `nuxt generate` we can host a static site for free, virtually
            indefinitely.
